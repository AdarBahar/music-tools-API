# Changelog

All notable changes to the Music Tools API project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Updated file naming convention for better organization
  - YouTube downloads now use video title as filename (no random IDs)
  - Stem files now include original filename with stem suffix
  - Example: `Song Title.mp3` â†’ `Song Title - vocals.mp3`
- Increased filename character limit from 100 to 200 characters
- Enhanced character sanitization for better filesystem compatibility
- **Improved**: Stems parameter now defaults to all stems when empty or null
  - No need to specify `stems=vocals,drums,bass,other` for full separation
  - Empty string, null, or omitted parameter extracts all stems by default

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite for filename generation
- Comprehensive test suite for stems parameter default behavior
- Detailed documentation for new naming convention
- Enhanced API documentation with stems parameter behavior examples
